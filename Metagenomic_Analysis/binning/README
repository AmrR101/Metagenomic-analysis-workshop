For the bin_quality.sh scripts, in this folder I added only scripts to calculate quality stats for spades_metabat bins. 
If you are interested in running the scripts for metabat as well, here are the steps 

1)Copy the job script file with a new name
	cp spades_bin_quality.sh metabat_bin_quality.sh

2) In the script, you will want to replace the directory names from spades_* to megahit_*. You can do this manually, or run the following commands
	sed -i 's/spades/megahit/g' megahit_bin_quality.sh

WARNING:The sed command only works if your files have the same convention as spades bin directory. For example, in this case, the bins from spades
assembly is saved to spades_metabat, and bins from megahit is saved to megahit_metabat. 

3) If you have a lot of bins, reading the "bins_quality_report" generated from the bin_quality.sh can be difficult to read, since this file concatenates
results from all the different tools to one file. 

Alternate options is really to take a look each programs results, and generate your own table manually or using more bash/python magic. 
Furure directions:I am working on updating this report, so next chance I get I will fix this problem!

4) The script fastANI - This is to calulate average nucleotide frequency (ANI), for each bin with the identified taxa.
